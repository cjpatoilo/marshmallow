- Commas should have a space after them.
- Keep else statements on the same line as their curly braces.
- For multi-line if statements, use curly braces.
- Always handle the `err` function parameter.
- Always prefix browser globals with `window.`.
- Multiple blank lines not allowed.
- For the ternary operator in a multi-line setting, place `?` and `:` on their own lines.
- For var declarations, write each declaration in its own statement.
- Wrap conditional assignments with additional parentheses. This makes it clear that the expression is intentionally an assignment (`=`) rather than a typo for equality (`===`).

**For Stylesheet:**

- Properties and selectors are sorted in alphabetical order
- Always use tab to indentation, no spaces
- Always use single quote, i.e. `content: ''`
- Quote attribute values in selectors, i.e. `input[type='checkbox']`
- Avoid specifying units for zero-values, i.e. `margin: 0`
- Use `rem` unit instead of `px`
- Use lowercase and shorthand hex values, i.e. `#fff`
- Use one discrete selector per line in multi-selector rulesets
- Include a single space after colon and after each comma
- Separate each ruleset by a blank line
- Don't use prefixes, there is a task to generate this automatically

```sass
.selector-a,
.selector-b,
.selector-c,
.selector-d[type='text']
	box-sizing: border-box
	color: #333
	content: ''
	display: inline-block
	font-family: 'Helvetica-Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif
	margin-bottom: 0
	margin-left: 5.0rem

	.other-selector-a
		background: #fff

		.other-selector-b
			background: #fff

		&.increasing-the-specificity
			color: #000
```

*NOTE: The best way to learn about that is to just install it and give it a try on your code. This project uses an `.editorconfig` file, which most editors support, to enforce these coding standards.*

## Test
